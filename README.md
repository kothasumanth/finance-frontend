# Finance Copilot React Frontend

This is the frontend for the Finance Copilot project, built with React and Vite. It provides a modern, user-friendly interface to view user data from the backend API.

## Features
- Modern React (Vite) setup
- Fetches user data from the backend API
- Displays users in a clean, responsive table

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server
```sh
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### 3. Connect to the backend
Make sure the Finance Copilot backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) is running and accessible. By default, the frontend expects the backend API to be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps
- Implement the user table UI in `src/App.jsx` to fetch and display users from the backend.
- Customize styles in `src/App.css` as needed.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - React source code
- `public/` - Static assets
